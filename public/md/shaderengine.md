In Fall of 2023, I took a graphics programming course. It kickstarted my interest in making shaders, mainly post-processing effects.  
Around the same time, I started a music project and wanted to create visuals for it. I used Shadertoy to do this, but I quickly got frustrated by its limitationsâ€”namely, the fact that it's a website, so I couldn't use my own IDE (without doing a lot of extra work), and its video recording feature was subpar at best.
Because of these gripes, my interest in OpenGL, and my desire to learn Go, I decided to make a **"Shader Engine"** (instead of a "toy").  
It currently supports recording at any inputted FPS, using video and images as sampler inputs, and visually has the same capabilities as Shadertoy.

Going forward, I'd like to do more work to get audio capabilities, as well as potentially create a format for making scripted sequences using shaders that sync with audio.
