**Tetron** is a top-down rogue-lite twin-stick shooter. It is one of the projects I am most proud of because I designed and created every single aspect of it. Every line of code, art asset, and sound was created by me. This includes over 30 enemies, level generation, 4 characters (with different abilities), a map system, meta-game progression, and much more.

I began working on it around when COVID started and worked on it passionately for about 8 months, ultimately releasing it on Steam.

Looking back, there's very little I would change about how I approached creating it. The art style is simplistic, but considering that art isn't my primary background, I'm very proud of what I ended up producing visually. The code for the game is some of the cleanest I had ever written for a Gamemaker project, and the final product is highly polished.

There are some balance changes I’d like to make eventually, and I may return to improve the music—possibly adding more tracks and improving the mixing.

**PS:** If you are a journalist or employer who wants access to the game, feel free to contact me—I'm happy to provide a Steam key free of charge.
