**Origami Bird Battle** was made with a dynamic group of 20 people in the Brown RISD Game Developers. It’s an intense, lighthearted, and fun 1v1 brawler.

We used Godot as the engine, and I was one of the few on the team with prior experience in it. My main role was architecting the codebase, delegating tasks among about 10 programmers (most of whom were new to coding), mentoring them, and coding parts that needed extra support.

I had a lot of fun working on this project, which felt like a culmination of lessons learned from previous experiences—especially in programmer retention. Nearly every programmer who started stayed involved in some capacity until the end, which is not always common in our club. I partly credit that to my efforts guiding newcomers throughout the process.

If I could go back, I’d improve communication with the artists and ensure they clearly understood their roles as well.
