I made this game with a few other artists for the month-long **Geopipe Game Jam** in January 2023. I helped create destruction effects, the map, cameras, and the main golf swing mechanics. I also guided some of the programming and design direction.

Working on this project was incredibly fun and rewarding. At the start, I was on break and helped make the initial prototype. When we returned to school, we rented a conference room to stay in and work together at night. Lots of bug fixes, banter, and snacks were had in that conference room.

At the end of the jam, we didn’t expect much—but when the announcements were made, I remember going to one of Brown’s dining areas to watch. I was incredibly surprised when we ended up winning. Afterward, we all got dinner together using some of the cash prizes from the competition.

It was one of the first times I had ever been properly paid for game development. Overall, I learned a lot and it was a fantastic experience.
