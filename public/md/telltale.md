**Tell Tale Heart** was made with Brown RISD Game Developers in Fall 2022. It is a 3D first-person stealth-based horror game. I served as both a programmer and sound designer for this project, and I also blocked out the main level.

I learned a lot from this experience—particularly about clean coding practices and component-based design. There are scripts I wrote for this project that I still use in other projects and prototypes. For example, I created an **"Eyes"** script, which allows AI to detect players or other objects and emits events when they’re seen. It was used for both the enemies and the cameras scattered around the level, and it's modular enough to reuse in future projects. I applied a similar modular approach to UI logic and AI sound mechanics as well.

If I could go back, I would have spent more time on the level design. While we iterated on mechanics and art throughout the semester, we didn’t finalize the level until the last few sessions. Since it’s one of the few 3D games ever made by Brown RISD Game Developers, some of those late-stage design hurdles were hard to anticipate—but they gave me clear lessons for next time.
