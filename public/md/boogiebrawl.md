**Boogie Brawl** was the first game I ever made with the Brown RISD Game Developers Club. It’s a rhythm-based, 2-player dance game where you attack and defend on the beat.

I pitched the original idea as a *disco-themed JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure*—which I quickly learned was the fastest way to win over design students (even though I don’t actually watch anime). I served as both a programmer and designer on the project, working on the rhythm backend (mainly BPM handling) and the battle mechanics.

It was also my first time working on a game with a larger team and collaborating with artists. I had a lot of fun and learned a ton.

If I could go back, I’d probably change or add a few mechanics to make the gameplay more interesting, and I would spend more time on polish. I remember the project hitting a bit of a stagnant point halfway through, and since then I’ve learned better ways to manage momentum in collaborative work.

Overall, though, I’m incredibly happy with the outcome.
