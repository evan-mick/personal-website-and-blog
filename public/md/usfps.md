## Tools: Unreal, Blueprints, and Git

**US(F)PS** was envisioned as a chaotic, over-the-top ‘merican delivery simulator. I worked on it with Brown RISD Game Developers from January to May 2023, mostly on Saturdays.

For this project, I handled programming and some of the sound effects (the explosions, gunshots, UI sounds, etc. were my work). I also took on a more pivotal technical role than usual, as I was one of the few people in the club with prior experience using Unreal. Teaching others how to use Blueprints was a challenge—but a rewarding one that taught me a lot about leadership, especially in a programming-heavy setting.

Because I was helping so many other team members, I ended up touching almost every mechanic in the game. We were also a smaller team that semester and ran into some trouble with art production—partly because it was a 3D game, which is a bigger lift. That situation taught me a lot about when and how to downscope and adjust expectations.

If I could go back, I’d advocate for scrapping or reworking certain design decisions earlier in the process. I also wish we’d taken a more programmatic approach to planning the game’s scope and systems from the beginning. That said, the project still ended up being pretty fun—and I think we succeeded in capturing the absurd delivery-action vibe we set out to achieve.
