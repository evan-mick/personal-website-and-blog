## Tools: SwiftUI, Metal, XCode

 Worked on an app using SwiftUI for an unannounced battery startup. For the front display, I was able to make use of my knowledge of shaders to have an interactive display using Metal. In addition, I am working to interface the app with a custom battery external accessory to pull battery charge and naming information using Apple's external hardware libraries. It was an interesting and exciting project for me to work on as I had not previously done a ton of hardware or app development work.
