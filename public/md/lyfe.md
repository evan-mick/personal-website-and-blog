## Tools: SwiftUI, Metal, XCode

 Currently working on an app using SwiftUI for an unannounced battery startup. For the front display, I was able to make use of my knowledge of shaders to have an interactive display using Metal. In addition, I am working to interface the app with a custom battery external accessory to pull battery charge and naming information using Apple's external hardware libraries. This is a very exciting project for me to work on as I have not previously done a ton of hardware or app development work.
