**Ascension** is a 3D zero-gravity first-person shooter developed as part of Brown RISD Game Developers in Spring 2022. I worked on programming, sound, and level design for the project. It was one of the first fully finished 3D games I had worked on, and it was a lot of fun to build.

The central mechanic is that the player is in zero gravity and uses the **recoil of their gun to move** and traverse the environment. I focused on building the level mechanics (in a way that was accessible to non-programmers) and refining the movement system to match the zero-G feel.

If I could go back, I’d spend more time improving the lighting. Many of the models looked great, but the levels felt a bit lifeless due to flat lighting. I also think we could have done more to clearly communicate the main mechanics and polish the UI.

Despite the time constraints of a semester-long student project, I’m proud of what we built—and it's definitely an idea I’d like to revisit in the future.
