I made this with a close game dev friend of mine from Brown for the week-long 2022 Brackey’s game jam (RIP Brackey’s). It is a dialogue-based detective game with a cool twist at the end. For it, I did design, sound, programming, and, for the first and only time in my life so far, writing (!). Every line of dialogue was written by yours truly, and I’ve gone back and played it and still been proud of it.

I programmed the dialogue mechanics (which is the bulk of the game haha) and general game logic. I also made the music and sound effects. My friend made the art and assisted with programming.

Looking back, I don’t think there is anything I would have done differently. The game was well received and still gets a surprising number of plays to this day (probably mostly because my friend happens to be an established game dev youtuber). The game ended up really polished and though simple it is an interesting experience.
