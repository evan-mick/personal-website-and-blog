This project was made in July 2023 for the annual **Game Maker’s Toolkit Game Jam**. The theme was *“Roles Reversed”*, and we had 48 hours to make a video game from scratch. We chose the idea that instead of controlling a plane, the player controls the **wind** guiding the plane.

I worked on this project over a weekend while I was at 2K. It was a fun contrast to come out of the office and dive into a quick games project. I contributed to the programming side, implementing a parallax scrolling effect, the enemy mechanics, and polishing gameplay to make it more accessible. I also did some refactoring to allow us to add more content within our short time frame.

If I could go back, I would have taken another hour or two to polish the movement and traversal a bit more. I also wish we had included a death state (you technically can’t “lose” the game, but are encouraged to go fast). The rest of the team preferred it without, so I went along with the decision.

This was my third GMTK Game Jam. The other two aren’t featured on this site—one was from early high school, and the other had… *room for improvement*.  
This was also the best-placed GMTK game I’ve worked on (top 8%), thanks in large part to our incredibly talented art team who elevated the game’s presentation.
