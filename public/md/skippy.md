**Skippy** was made for the Virtual Pet Jam in January 2022. It is a full motion video-based interactive experience where you raise a pet alien. 

I contributed programming, sound, music, and minigame design to the project. It was my first time editing video sounds directly using Logic, which was a fun learning experience. I also created all the audio for the final cutsceneâ€”something I had never done before.

The game received a lot of positive feedback and placed 11th out of 124 entries in the jam.

Looking back, I wish we had expanded the minigames more. They could have been better communicated and made more interesting. They were also a bit too difficult, so we compensated by making only small portions required at a time.
