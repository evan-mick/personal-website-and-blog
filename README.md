Hi! Welcome to the code for my website. It uses Next.js and Tailwind. Also, eventually I am going to add a blog and music page once I have some content for that. 
A lot of this readme is the default Next.js stuff, keeping in here in case any n00bs wanna learn haha. 

The content for the project pages can be found in "projectData.tsx" in the constants folder. There are some resusable components for displaying projects, and lastly the general project structure follows Next.js's new app conventions. 

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server, we use yarn
```bash
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
