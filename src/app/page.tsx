            I am a new grad Computer Science and Economics major from Brown
            University, and I am well-versed in software engineering and product
            management. I am also a passionate game developer and musician. This
            website exists as a place for employers to see my experiences and
            for me to show off my software, music, and thoughts in a centralized
            place.

            As a participant in Capitalism, I seek gainful employment. My latest
            attempt was from May to August of 2024. I am happy to say that,
            thanks to the purchasing of V-bucks from the credit cards of
            millions of parents worldwide, I was employed at Epic Games as a
            "Gameplay Programming Intern," where I worked on Fortnite Festival
            using Unreal Engine and C++ on the Harmonix team.

            From June to November of 2023, I worked at 2K Games as a "Software
            Engineering, Product Management Intern" (a bit of a mouthful, I
            know). There, I helped analyze the onboarding experience and costs
            of their backend services used across 2K's titles by incorporating
            them in my own Unreal projects, talking to customers, and undergoing
            market research.

            At Brown University, I am part of the executive board for Brown RISD
            Game Developers. During my time there, I have contributed to the
            development of five video games, helped manage our yearly average of
            roughly 100 students, and taught other students how to use Unity and
            Unreal effectively. I have also been a TA for two computer science
            courses, Computer Graphics, and 2D Game engines.

            I have been programming and creating games since before high school,
            and thus have a deep understanding of applied programming practices
            and experience with a wide range of languages. Here are some
            languages and tools I am familiar with, and where I made use of
            them.
